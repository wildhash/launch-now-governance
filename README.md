# launch-now-governance

Launch Now is a wallet-native governance and growth protocol that encodes Convergent Facilitation on-chain — transforming dissent into consensus and rewarding the integration of all human needs.

## 🌟 Overview

Launch Now DAO reimagines decentralized governance by replacing majority voting with **Convergence Rule** — a three-phase protocol inspired by *The Highest Common Denominator* framework. Instead of competing preferences, we integrate diverse needs to achieve decisions that everyone can accept as their own.

### Key Principles

- **Convergence over Consensus**: Move beyond simple majority to true integration
- **Dissent as Data**: Every objection is valuable information to improve proposals
- **Willingness-Based Decisions**: Record "willing/unwilling" not yes/no votes
- **On-Chain Facilitation**: Smart contracts embed Convergent Facilitation methodology
- **AI-Augmented Integration**: Omni + Reflexion agents help integrate outlier perspectives

## 📚 Documentation

- [**Governance System**](docs/governance.md) - Full governance architecture, smart contract model, and cultural charter
- [**Token Economics**](docs/token-economics.md) - LN-GOV token design, rewards, and treasury management

## 🏗 Architecture

Our governance system operates through five integrated layers:

1. **Commons Mandate** - Shared purpose encoded via NFT signature
2. **Convergent Decision Protocol** - Three-phase smart contract workflow
3. **Outlier Inclusion Engine** - AI-powered dissent integration
4. **Steward Council** - Rotating facilitators with reputation weighting
5. **Transparency Layer** - On-chain logs and governance dashboard

## 🔄 Three-Phase Protocol

### Phase 1: Criteria
Participants submit their needs and concerns, which are distilled into "noncontroversial essence" — the underlying needs everyone can accept.

### Phase 2: Proposal
Solutions are crafted to address all identified criteria, ensuring every voice is integrated into the final design.

### Phase 3: Decision
Members record their willingness (not preference) to accept the proposal. Proposals only pass when all participants are willing — dissent triggers re-integration, not override.

## 🪙 Token Economics

The **LN-GOV token** rewards:
- Criteria submission (articulating needs)
- Proposal creation (integrating diverse perspectives)
- Facilitation (guiding convergence process)
- Willingness voting (participating with rationale)

Facilitators stake tokens as an integrity commitment — stakes are slashed for coercive behavior detected by the Guardian Agent.

## 🤖 AI Agent Roles

| Agent                | Function                                       |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Omni Facilitator** | Extracts criteria, moderates convergence       |
| **Reflexion Engine** | Learns from prior decisions to improve process |
| **Guardian Agent**   | Detects coercion patterns & integrity breaches |

## 📊 Governance Metrics

We track quantitative health indicators:
- **Convergence Score**: % of criteria met per proposal
- **Inclusion Index**: Unique voices represented / total participants
- **Facilitation Integrity**: Dissent resolved / total dissent
- **Governance Health**: Weighted mean of all metrics

## 🌱 Getting Started

1. Review the [Governance Documentation](docs/governance.md)
2. Understand the [Token Economics](docs/token-economics.md)
3. Join as a participant or facilitator
4. Submit criteria representing your genuine needs
5. Contribute to proposals that integrate all voices

## 🎯 Cultural Charter

- Everyone matters; nothing coerced
- Dissent = Data
- Steward the Whole
- Transparency = Trust
- Willingness > Preference
