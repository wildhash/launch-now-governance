# Assets Directory

This directory is reserved for visual assets and diagram exports related to the Launch Now governance system.

## Planned Contents

- Exported PNG/SVG versions of Mermaid diagrams
- Architecture diagrams
- UI mockups for governance dashboard
- Infographics explaining Convergent Facilitation
- Token flow visualizations

## Note

The primary diagrams are currently embedded as Mermaid code in the documentation files:
- `governance.md` contains the Token-Economic Flow and Governance Cycle diagrams
- These render automatically in GitHub and most Markdown viewers

Static image exports can be added here for use in presentations, websites, or contexts where Mermaid rendering is not available.
